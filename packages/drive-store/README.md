# Drive compatibility layer

This allows other applications to use the Drive store, while we work on implementing a real core library.

-   Copied store lives in `./store`
    -   We also copy `./hooks`, `./components` and `./utils`
-   Patches for the store live in `./patches` as diffs
-   Extra functionality lives in `./lib`
