# Payments Package Testing Workflow

When creating or modifying tests for files in the payments package, follow this testing workflow:

## Testing Process
1. **Change Directory**: Navigate to the payments package: `cd packages/payments`  
2. **Run Tests**: Execute the test suite using `yarn test`
3. **Available Test Commands**:
   - `yarn test` - Run all tests once
   - `yarn test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode for development
   - `yarn test:ci` - Run tests in CI mode (single-threaded)

## Test File Structure
- Test files should be co-located with the source files they test
- Use `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extensions for test files

## Key Testing Considerations
- The payments package uses Jest as the testing framework
- Tests should cover payment method logic, validation, and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Ensure tests pass before submitting any changes

## Example Usage
```bash
cd packages/payments
yarn test                    # Run all tests
yarn test methods.test.ts    # Run specific test file
```

Always verify that new or modified tests pass before considering the work complete.
