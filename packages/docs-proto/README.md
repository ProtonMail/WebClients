# Protocol Buffers Definitions

This package is duplicated directly from https://gitlab.protontech.ch/drive/docs/protobuf-definitions via the sync script.

1. Run `yarn sync`

After syncing, webpack might start throwing some errors. In which case, delete node_modules from docs-editor, and docs (where webpack stores its cache).
