# Slider

```js
import { Slider } from '@proton/atoms';
```

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story id="components-slider--basic" />
</Canvas>

## Marks

You can use the slider with "marks" for the min & max values.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-slider--marks" />
</Canvas>

## Color

All Theme colors are available to color the Slider with.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-slider--color" />
</Canvas>

## Size

The Slider comes in two sizes "small" & "medium", where "medium" is the default when omitted.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-slider--size" />
</Canvas>

## Steps

The Slider is configurable to only allow values that round to a nearest "step" via the `step` property. If set, the thumb of the Slider won't move until the pointer that is dragging it is closer to a different step-point than the one where it currently is. In this configuration, the slider displays the real internal value of the slider as opposed to defaulting to `Math.round`, formatted based on the number of decimals found in the specified `step` value.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-slider--step" />
</Canvas>

## Min & Max

The `min` & `max` properties allow specifying in which numeric interval the Slider should operate.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-slider--min-max" />
</Canvas>

Although it doesn't fit the semantics of the concept of `min` & `max`, it is technically possible to have `max` be smaller than `min` if one wishes to invert the directionality of the `Slider`.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-slider--min-max-inverted" />
</Canvas>

## Custom value display format

The `getDisplayedValue` prop allows you to apply custom formatting to the real internal value of the slider. In the case where no step is specified, this value is a decimal as opposed to an integer value, however by default `Math.round` is used to format the real internal value for display.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-slider--custom-value-display-format" />
</Canvas>

## Props

The Slider interface supports all additional html attributes of the `<input />` element via rest spreading.

<div class="hidden">
    <Primary />
</div>

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
