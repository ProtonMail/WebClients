# Card

This component currently is a container with a bit of styling adhering to a "card / surface" concept, however design is pending on this so for now we're only adding this thin layer, no other card-related components or logic.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story id="components-card--basic" />
</Canvas>

### With Action

This isn't really part of the Card's api, it's just an example of a use-case commonly encountered.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-card--with-action-horizontal" />
</Canvas>

## Sandbox
<Story id="components-card--sandbox" />

## Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
