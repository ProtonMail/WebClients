# Stepper

```js
import { Stepper } from '@proton/atoms';
```

The `Stepper` displays progress through sequential steps. It is controlled by passing the current step index as the `activeStep` prop.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story id="components-stepper--basic" />
</Canvas>

## Position

The length of the connectors is limited to `120px`, meaning the `Step`'s might not fill the width of the `Stepper` container. You can use the `position` prop to set the position of the steps within the stepper.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-stepper--centered" />
</Canvas>

## Props

<div class="hidden">
    <Primary />
</div>

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
