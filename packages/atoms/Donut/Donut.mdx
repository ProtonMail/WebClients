# Donut

```js
import { Donut } from '@proton/atoms';
```

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story id="components-donut--basic" />
</Canvas>

## With slider

This isn't really part of the api, it's just used to demonstrate that the Donut is able to adapt in real time to react state changes (through the `segments` property), as well as automatically scale past 100 percent, should the percentages of all segments add up to more than 100.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-donut--with-slider" />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

Since the Donut itself is only visual to represent % share of allocation, one way to make this data accessible is to add screen-reader text inside assistive texts used to label the individual Donut segments.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-donut--accessibility" />
</Canvas>

## Props

<div class="hidden">
    <Primary />
</div>

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
