# Card

```js
import { DashboardCard } from '@proton/atoms';
```

This component currently is a container with a bit of styling adhering to a "card / surface" concept, however design is pending on this so for now we're only adding this thin layer, no other card-related components or logic.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story id="components-dashboardcard--basic" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
