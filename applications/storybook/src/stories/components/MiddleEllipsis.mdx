# MiddleEllipsis

When you don't have enough space to display something, but you want to display the end of this content. For sure, if you have enough room, ellipsis won't appear. :) 

## Basic

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-middle-ellipsis--basic" />
</Canvas>

## Without title

If this component is wrapped into a button with already a tooltip or a title, you might want not having the title, thanks to `displayTitle={false}`

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-middle-ellipsis--title" />
</Canvas>

If needed, this component can have some additionnal classes.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-middle-ellipsis--classes" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={MiddleEllipsis} />
