# MiddleEllipsis

When you don't have enough space to display something, but you want to display the end of this content. For sure, if you have enough room, ellipsis won't appear. :)

### Basic

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story id="components-middleellipsis--basic" />
</Canvas>

### Without title

If this component is wrapped into a button with already a tooltip or a title, you might want not having the title, thanks to `displayTitle={false}`

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-middleellipsis--title" />
</Canvas>

If needed, this component can have some additional classes.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story id="components-middleellipsis--classes" />
</Canvas>

<div class="hidden">
    <Primary />
</div>

<ArgsTable of={MiddleEllipsis} />
