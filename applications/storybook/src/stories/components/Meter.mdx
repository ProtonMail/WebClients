# Meter

The `Meter` component must only be used for a visual rendering of a graduated and limited value, not for a progression. For a progression value, see [Progress](?path=/docs/components-progress--basic#progress) component.

-   `min` is the minimum value of your data, lower than `max`
-   `max` is the maximum value of your data, higher than `min`
-   `low` is a value of your data that can be understood as low, within the range of min and `max`
-   `high` is a value of your data that can be understood as high, within the range of min and `max`
-   `optimum` is the optimal value of your data, within the range of `min` and `max`. This will influent the behaviour of `low` and `high`: it gives an indication where along the range is considered preferable. For example, if it is between the `min` attribute and the `low` attribute, then the lower range is considered preferred.

Further explanations:

-   If the `optimum` value is lower than `low` value, it indicates that the lower values are optimum, so lower values will be green, between `low` and `high` will be yellow, and red higher than `high`
-   If the `optimum` value is higher than `high` value, it indicates that the higher values are optimum, so lower values will be red, between `low` and `high` will be yellow, and green higher than `high`
-   If the `optimum` value is between `low` and `high` values, it indicates that extremes values aren't the best, so they will be yellow, and values between `low` and `high` will be green

For simplicity, we have set default parameters of the `<Meter>` react component as if you would use a percentage, so they are `min="0"` `max="100"` `low="50"` `high="80"` `optimum="0"`. With those default values, since `optimum` value is lower than low value, you will have:

-   Green between `0` and `49`
-   Yellow between `50` and `79`
-   Red from `80`, including higher than `100`
