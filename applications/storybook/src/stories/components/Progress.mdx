# Progress

`Progress` represents the completion progress of a task. This component is not suitable for representing a gauge (e.g. disk space usage or relevance of a query result). To represent a gauge, use the `Meter` component instead.

### Basic

Update the `value` attribute of the progress bar and the text explaining the action in progress.
