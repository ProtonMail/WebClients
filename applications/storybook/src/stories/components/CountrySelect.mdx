# CountrySelect

### Basic

Display given country options in a searchable dropdown. Options are sorted by name, grouped by their first letter and a divider is added between "groups".

<Canvas withSource="false">
    <Story id="components-countryselect--basic" />
</Canvas>

### Playground

In case you want to add a suggestion to the user, it's possible to pass an option that will be pre-selected in the input. This will add a new option displayed at the top of the dropdown.

<Story id="components-countryselect--pre-select" />

### Props

<div class="hidden">
    <Primary />
</div>

<ArgTypes story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
