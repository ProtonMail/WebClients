# Card

This component currently is a container with a bit of styling adhering to a "card / well" concept, however design is pending on this so for now we're only adding this thin layer, no other card-related components or logic.

### Basic

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-card--basic" />
</Canvas>

### With Action

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-card--with-action-horizontal" />
</Canvas>
