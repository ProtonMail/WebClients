# Card

This component currently is a container with a bit of styling adhering to a "card / well" concept, however design is pending on this so for now we're only adding this thin layer, no other card-related components or logic.

## Basic

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-card--basic" />
</Canvas>

## With Action

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-card--with-action-horizontal" />
</Canvas>

## Playground

<Primary />

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
