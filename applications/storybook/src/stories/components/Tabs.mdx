# Tabs

Simple responsive horizontal navigation tabs. `Tabs` organize and allow navigation between groups of content that are related and at the same level of hierarchy.

- The link between tabs and tab panels using `aria-controls` and `aria-labelledby`.
- The use of `role="tablist/presentation/tab/tabpanel"`.
- A selected tab has `aria-selected="true"`, `aria-selected="false"` if not.

### Basic

A simple example with no frills.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-tabs--basic" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Tabs} />
