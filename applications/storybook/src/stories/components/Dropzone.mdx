# Dropzone

The Dropzone component provides an area to drag and drop files onto, most likely for uploading.

Extra props are spread on the container element, not the overlay.

Small notes on the vocabulary we use:

- **Children** is what you see when you are not dragging files.
- **Content** is what you see in your dropzone when you are dragging files. By default, there is a content set for sizes `small`/`medium`/`large`. But you can override it with the prop `customContent`.

**Warning for developers:**

In the Dropzone component code, we wanted to avoid creating a container div which would contain the dropzone children and content. This could have caused issues in certain cases (Mostly CSS display which could have created a conflict, meaning that the developer would have needed to create CSS specificities). Instead, we are cloning the children component, and we add it some new props and the dropzone content as a new children. It means that if you want the dropzone to work properly, you might have to spread the rest operator in the children container div of your react component + render the children we're passing. A good example of this usage is in InteractiveCalendarView, which is rendering the TimeGrid. In TimeGrid, we spread the rest prop and render a new children

## Playground

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-dropzone--custom" />
</Canvas>

## Invisible Dropzone

If you want to get a Dropzone that shows no content when hovering but keeps showing the children instead, use the shape `invisible`.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-dropzone--invisible" />
</Canvas>

<ArgTypes story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
