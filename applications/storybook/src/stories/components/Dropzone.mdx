# Dropzone

The Dropzone component provides an area to drag and drop files onto, most likely for uploading.

Extra props are spread on the container element, not the overlay.

Small notes on the vocabulary we use:

-   **Children** is what you see when you are not dragging files.
-   **Content** is what you see in your dropzone when you are dragging files. By default, there is a content set for sizes `small`/`medium`/`large`. But you can override it with the prop `customContent`.

## Playground

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-dropzone--custom" />
</Canvas>

## Invisible Dropzone

If you want to get a Dropzone that shows no content when hovering but keeps showing the children instead, use the shape `invisible`.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-dropzone--invisible" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
