# InputButton

`InputButton` is used to obtain either checkbox or radio functionality, however with the input element being represented as a circular button.

### Basic

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-inputbutton--basic" />
</Canvas>

### Multiple

Checkbox style usage of this component. Under the hood this is the same as `<input type="checkbox" />`.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-inputbutton--multiple" />
</Canvas>

### Exclusive

You can of course also render an array of this component and make only a single value selectable using the `checked` prop and handling that logic yourself.

When you need to use this component like just described, please make sure to make it a `type="radio"`. That makes for better for accessibility (semantics & keyboard navigation). Be aware that this also changes the interface usage of this component in the same way it would for a native `<input type="radio" />`.
