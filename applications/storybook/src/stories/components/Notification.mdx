# Notification

Notifications are most easily used as part of a larger API exposed through the `useNotifications` hook.

## Deduplication

Notifications are deduplicated by default based on their `text` value. If a notification is created using a custom notification component, it cannot be deduplicated automatically. To deduplicate custom notifications, pass a unique `key` to the `createNotifaction` call.
