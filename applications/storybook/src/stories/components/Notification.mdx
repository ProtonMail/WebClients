# Notification

Notifications are most easily used as part of a larger API exposed through the `useNotifications` hook.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story id="components-notification--basic" />
</Canvas>

### Expiration

Use the `expiration` prop to set how long the notification stays open for in milliseconds. Defaults to `3500`.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-notification--expiration" />
</Canvas>
