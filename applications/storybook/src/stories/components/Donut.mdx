## With slider

This isn't really part of the api, it's just used to demonstrate that the Donut is able to
adapt in real time to react state changes (through the `chunks` property), as well as automatically
scale past 100 percent, should the percentages of all chunks add up to more than 100.

</Canvas>

## Accessibility

Since the Donut itself is only visual to represent % share of allocation, one way to make this data
accessible is to add screen-reader text inside assistive texts used to label the individual Donut segments.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-donut--accessibility" />
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
