# Slider

<Canvas withSource="open">

</Canvas>

## Steps

The Slider is configurable to only allow values that round to a nearest "step" via the `step` property.
If set, the thumb of the Slider won't move until the pointer that is dragging it is closer to a different
step-point than the one where it currently is. In this configuration, the slider displays the real internal
value of the slider as opposed to defaulting to `Math.round`, formatted based on the number of decimals found
in the specified `step` value.

  <Story id="components-slider--step" />
</Canvas>

## Min & Max

The `min` & `max` properties allow specifying in which numeric interval the Slider should operate.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-slider--min-max" />
</Canvas>

## Custom value display format

The `getDisplayedValue` prop allows you to apply custom formatting to the real internal value of the slider.
In the case where no step is specified, this value is a decimal as opposed to an integer value, however by
default `Math.round` is used to format the real internal value for display.

## Props

The Slider interface supports all additional html attributes of the `<input />` element via rest spreading.
