# Slider



Optional disclaimer / description / explanation / extra info of usage.
This should be of technical nature not of design philosophy nature.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story id="components-slider--basic" />
</Canvas>

## Steps

The Slider is configurable to only allow values that round to a nearest "step" via the `step` property.
If set, the thumb of the Slider won't move until the pointer that is dragging it is closer to a different
step-point than the one where it currently is.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-slider--step" />
</Canvas>

## Min & Max

The `min` & `max` properties allow specifying in which numeric interval the Slider should operate.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-slider--min-max" />
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
