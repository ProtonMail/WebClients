# Scroll

```javascript
import { Scroll } from '@proton/components'
```

The `Scroll` component is a utility component which makes an area scrollable should its content overflow the maximum dimensions of its parent.
It also adds some styling in the form of shadows to indicate to the user that an area is scrollable/has off-screen parts.

<Primary />

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
