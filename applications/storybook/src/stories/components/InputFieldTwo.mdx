# InputField

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-inputfieldtwo--basic" />
</Canvas>

## Validation

The `error` and `warning` props toggle the error state. If a node is provided, the `assistiveText` will be replaced.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-inputfieldtwo--validation" />
</Canvas>

## Adornments

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-inputfieldtwo--adornments" />
</Canvas>

## Sizes

The `bigger` prop to increases the size.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-inputfieldtwo--sizes" />
</Canvas>

## Dense inputs

No assistive text, inline error appears as tooltip. Used where space is scarce.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-inputfieldtwo--dense" />
</Canvas>

## Custom elements

The `as` prop allows for InputField to render as another element.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-inputfieldtwo--custom-elements" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
