# Badge

The `Badge` is a small but versatile element. It's very useful as a way to attach information to a block or other component. Its size makes it also easy to display in numbers, making it appropriate for long lists of items.

### Basic Badge

Like with buttons, there are different colors available.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-badge--basic" />
</Canvas>

### With className

You can easily customize the `Badge` by adding a `className`. By default `mr1` is set to the `className` prop.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-badge--with-class-name" />
</Canvas>

### With tooltip

By using `tooltip` prop, you can attach a Javascript tooltip to it.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-badge--with-tooltip" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
