# Responsive and media queries

In order to be able to write CSS/SCSS media queries in an easy and maintainable way with a natural and simplistic syntax, we are using the [include-media library](https://eduardoboucas.github.io/include-media/).

## Basics

The library comes with a list of default breakpoints that we changed for our needs:

<Source
    language="css"
    format
    copy={false}
    code={`
/* Variable set in the design system's config. You don't have to create another one. */
$breakpoints: im-to-em((
    'xlarge': 1500px,
    'large' : 1100px,
    'medium': 910px,
    'small' : 680px,
    'xsmall': 450px,
));
 
/* Inclusive and exclusive operators for a finer control over the intervals */
@include media(">small", "<=medium") {
    width: 50%;
}
 
/* Use ligatured operators if you fancy a slicker declaration */
@include media(">small", "≤medium") {
    line-height: 1.5;
}
`}
/>

Those value are already overrided for some apps, Mail and Calendar as I'm writing this line.

`$breakpoints` is a map variable specific to include-media.

`im-to-em`, standing for _include media to em unit_, is a specific helper for converting pixel values into em values. This way, these values are kept as reachable as possible.

Due to the wide variety of devices, and their diversity in size, we no longer mention any device in the naming. From now on, it will be graduated sizes from `xsmall` to `xlarge`, leaving us the possibility to extend the list as needed.

<Alert type="warning">
    As a recommandation, please always use inclusive value for max witdh (
    <b>
        <code>&lt;=</code>
    </b>
    ) and exclusive value for min width (<b>
        <code>&gt;</code>
    </b>
    ).

## On-the-fly breakpoints

Some elements require additional rules on intermediate breakpoints, so you can create media queries that use both global breakpoints and case-specific values.

<Alert type="warning">Always make sure that you need a specific breakpoint. Challenge the design if necessary.</Alert>

<Source
    language="css"
    format
    copy={false}
    code={`
@include media('<=#{em(640, 16)}') {
    display: none;
}
`}
/>

Here, we need to convert the pixel value `640` into an em value, so we are using the `em` function with the `16` base font size, which is the browser default.

<Alert type="warning">
    Always convert media query pixel breakpoints into <code>em</code>… or use an <code>em</code> value directly. This
    makes the breapoint browser zooming compatible.
</Alert>

## Smart support for media types

Media types and static expressions are optional and automatically deferred. The list of media types is declared by `$media-expressions`.

<Source
    language="css"
    format
    copy={false}
    code={`
/* Variable set in the design system's config. You don't have to create another one. */
$media-expressions: (
    'screen': 'screen',
    'print': 'print',
    'mouse': '(hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)',
    'touch': '(hover: hover) and (pointer: coarse), (hover: none)',
    'landscape': '(orientation: landscape)',
    'portrait': '(orientation: portrait)',
    'reduced-motion': '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)',
);
 
@include media('mouse', '>small') {
    display: inline-flex;
}
`}
/>

## Height-based media queries

All expressions result in a `min-width` or `max-width` expression by default, but you can explicitly use any breakpoint with `min-height` and `max-height` instead.

<Source
    language="css"
    format
    copy={false}
    code={`
@include media('height>small', 'height<=#{em(600, 16)}') {
    height: 50%;
}
`}
/>
