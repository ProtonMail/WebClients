# Applications theming

## Context

It can be difficult to add a theming mechanism to a design system without duplication. With this in mind, we have taken an approach which aims to minimize duplication by **moving all references of what can be themeable into theming files outside of the design system**.

Each [_theme file_](https://github.com/ProtonMail/WebClients/tree/main/packages/colors/themes/dist) defines the values that can be themeable (colors, radius, shadow spread, font faces, etc.) which can be predetermined or customized by the user. Hence, theming is achieved by switching between these theme files.

## Standard and Prominent layout

The applications interface is separated into two sections: the **main** section and the **header/navigation** section.

Since the default theme uses different text and background colors in these sections, it makes sense to separate them in the theming files too.

<figure className="text-center">
    <ThemeSvg size="large" colors={PROTON_THEMES_MAP[PROTON_DEFAULT_THEME].thumbColors} className="shadow-lifted w25" />
    <figcaption className="text-sm mt-2 mb-0 text-italic">Proton default theme</figcaption>
</figure>

To do this we use `.ui-standard` for the main section styles and `.ui-prominent` for the header/navigation section styles.

To avoid the performance and maintainability nightmare of having to redefine each variable for each ui section, `.ui-prominent` is defined as an override of `.ui-standard`. This means each variable defined in `.ui-standard` is already defined in `.ui-prominent`.

_Variables should not be **redefined** inside of `.ui-prominent`, but **overridden** instead._

```css
:root,
.ui-standard {
    --css-variable: value;
}
.ui-prominent {
    --css-variable: overridden-value;
}
```

`:root` is defined with `.ui-standard` then `.ui-prominent` is defined, giving us a mechanism to define a section as prominent and one of its children as standard.

This is useful in some cases. For example, if we want a section to share the prominent styling, such as the title bar of the mail composer, we simply add the `ui-prominent` class to it.

## Variable abstraction layer

Each variable can be **used anywhere in the design system** in many contexts of use, meaning the naming of variables is abstracted. For example, the variable name referring to a color **must not refer to the color itself**, but to an **abstraction of the color**. This applies to any other themeable property.

**This abstraction layer is the basis of theming management** and must be carefully gatekept.

```css
:root,
.ui-standard {
    --text-norm: #262a33;
    --background-norm: white;
}
.ui-prominent {
    --text-norm: white;
    --background-norm: #1c223d;
}
```

<Alert type="info">
    These variables should not be defined by anyone other than the design team in collaboration with the core team. If
    you think a variable is missing, please refer it to them.
</Alert>

To the attention of the design team and the core team: if you think you need to add a new variable or variable group, **challenge it strongly first**. The idea is to avoid any usage duplication and the addition of too many variables resulting in the theming files being hard to maintain.

## Optional variables

We use CSS custom properties (known as CSS variables) to achieve the theming mechanism. Since CSS `var()` allows the addition of **one or several fallback values**, we are able to default a referred value if it doesn't exist.

This means the first value can be handled as an **optional contextual themeable value**.

```css
selector {
    property: var(--optional-var, var(--fallback-var));
}
```

Optional variables are created for **two purposes**:

-   Allowing users to easily modify themes, for example customizing themes by injecting css
-   Enabling adaptation of properties for a specific theme in [certain cases](/docs/core-concepts-theming-usage--page#themeable-value-with-optional)

Optional variables are usually only used for one situation, so it makes sense that an optional variable name refers to a specific context. The variable name must use train-case naming convention and be **as descriptive as possible to understand the context of use and impacted property**.

```css
&.unread {
    color: var(--email-item-unread-text-color);
}
```

**All optional variables are defined in a dedicated [mapping file](https://github.com/ProtonMail/WebClients/blob/main/packages/styles/scss/base/custom-properties/_optionals.scss)** helping maintainability, as all optional variables are in one place. It also **creates a layer to have `--optional` prefixed names for theme files**, making optional variables obvious to the design team.

```css
:root,
.ui-standard,
.ui-prominent {
    --email-item-unread-text-color: var(--optional-email-item-unread-text-color, var(--text-norm));
}
```
