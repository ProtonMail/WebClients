# Countdown

`Countdown` returns and iterates over days, hours, minutes and seconds to produce an accurate timespan between two `Date` instances. It does not include months or years.

### Basic

It takes 2 `Date` to start and end the countdown.

### With custom separator

By default, `Countdown` split the value with `|` but you can change it.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="to-update-countdown--separator" />
</Canvas>

### Render props api

You can provide a custom render function, which receives an object as its sole argument containing properties `diff`, `days`, `hours`, `minutes` and `seconds`.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="to-update-countdown--render" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Countdown} />
