# Gap

The `gap` property is used to add space between flex or grid elements.

## Gap values

All values are available for <a href="#equal">`gap`</a>, <a href="#gap-between-rows-y">`gap-y`</a> and <a href="#gap-between-columns-x">`gap-x`</a>.<br /> Additionally, all values are available to use for specific breakpoints: `sm`, `md`, `lg` and `xl`. <a href="#responsive">Read more about this here</a>

## Equal

Add equal gap to all sides of an element

<Story id="css-utilities-gap--gap" />

## Gap between Rows (Y)

Add a gap value between rows only. Can be combined with `gap-x-VALUE`.

<Story id="css-utilities-gap--gap-y" />

## Gap between Columns (X)

Add a gap value between columns only. Can be combined with `gap-y-VALUE`.

<Story id="css-utilities-gap--gap-x" />

## Responsive

The new helper classes are **all** available to use without media query, as well as `sm`, `md`, `lg` and `xl` variants. This allows to tweak spacings precicely for every breakpoint if needed. The blue square in the demo area underneath has the classes `gap-4 sm:gap-8 md:gap-10 lg:gap-12 xl:gap-14` which translates to gap 4 (16px) by default, 8 (32px) starting `small` breakpoint, 10 (40px) starting `medium` breakpoint, 12 (48px) starting `large` breakpoint and 14 (56px) starting `extra large` breakpoint. The system works **mobile first**, that means the base `gap-4` will be overridden by `lg:gap-12` on larger screens.
