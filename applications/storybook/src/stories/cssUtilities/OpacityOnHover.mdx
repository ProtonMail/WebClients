# Opacity on hover

## Show element only on <code>hover</code> over parent

This shows an element with `className="opacity-on-hover"` when hovering its parent container or when focus is inside the container (container needs `className="opacity-on-hover-container"`).

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story id="css-utilities-opacityonhover--opacity-on-hover" />
</Canvas>

Careful when using this, is appropriated for non-critical actions, and for actions related to the container (not to hide everything). If you want to use it on an element that needs to be present on mobile/touch or for a critical action, you might use `opacity-on-hover-only-desktop` helper (this one will make it always visible when user does not have a precise pointing capability).
