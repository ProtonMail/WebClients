# Interactive Focus styles

Utility classes designed to provide a consistent hover background and focus style for keyboard navigation. Focus rings will inherit border radius from `rounded` classes.

## `interactive`

Applies interactive hover and focus styles to block-level elements that already have a border.

</Canvas>

## `interactive-pseudo`

Provides the same interactive style as interactive, but implements the focus ring using a ::after pseudo-element. This requires the element to have a positioning class such as relative or absolute.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story id="css-utilities-interactivefocushelper--interactive-pseudo" />
</Canvas>

## `interactive-pseudo-inset`

Use when space is limited and the focus ring needs to be inset to avoid overflowing the elementâ€™s boundaries.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story id="css-utilities-interactivefocushelper--interactive-pseudo-inset" />
</Canvas>

## `interactive-pseudo-protrude`

Recommended for elements without padding, where a standard focus outline would appear too close to the content. This variant offsets the focus ring outward.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story id="css-utilities-interactivefocushelper--interactive-pseudo-protrude" />
</Canvas>

## `interactive--no-background`

Additional helper class to remove the default background on hover
