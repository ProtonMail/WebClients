# Category View Temporary Folder

This folder serves as a **temporary location** for the code related to the Category View feature.

## Structure

- **Component:**  
  Currently, the folder contains a single component responsible for rendering the category view pill.

- **Constants & Helpers:**  
  Some constants and helper functions are also included to support the component's functionality.

## Notes

- **Isolation:**  
  The constants are kept within this folder for now to keep the code isolated during the early stages of development.

- **Future Refactoring:**  
  Once the feature is more advanced, these constants should be moved to a more centralized location within the codebase.

---

_This setup is temporary and will evolve as the Category View feature matures._
